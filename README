LaserCam

This is a laser beam profiler designed for use with cheap webcams. Commercial
laser beam profilers cost a lot of money although they perform fairly simple 
calculations and often have horrible user interfaces. Optics researchers 
everywhere will hopefully profit from an open-source solution designed for
inexpensive hardware.

EASY-TO-READ TERMS OF USE
-------------------------
You are welcome to hack on this project, as long as I can decide when the first 
public release is. After that it becomes normal open source software. (See the
file `COPYING' for the full terms of use.)
